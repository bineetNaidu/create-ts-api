# Getting Started with create-ts-api

This api was bootstrapped with [create-ts-api](https://github.com/bineetNaidu/create-ts-api).

## Available Scripts

In the api directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the API in the production mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm dev:ts`

Runs the API in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run watch`

Watches and re-compiles on every changes made to the codebase.

### `npm run build`

Builds the API for production to the `dist` folder.

## Run in ease while developing

- open a new terminal and run `npm run watch`
- then open another terminal and run `npm run dev`

**_this will get faster as it automatically re-compiles on the background_**
